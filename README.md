sattools
========

SAT tools - small SAT formula generator from assignments, some algorithms. NOT intended for efficiency.
I'm working on a research project around SAT - and I need a few tools around that, including simulation of algorithms I'm currently working on with different variants. I'm trying to get my code as generic and proper/usable as possible so that it may be used by other people!
Said algorithms are, however, much more on the theoretic/exponential bounds side - this is typically NOT a SAT solver that will solve anything "big" in any remotely reasonable time. We're talking Theta(2^n) time here. Don't expect better.
